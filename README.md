Helm Chart for Webapp
Web Application Helm Chart
This Helm chart is designed to deploy a web application on a Kubernetes cluster with various features and best practices.

Application Health Probes
This Helm chart includes HTTP-based Readiness and Liveness probes for the web application.

Readiness Probe: Ensures that the application can connect to the database and is ready to serve traffic. It will fail if the application cannot connect to the database.

Liveness Probe: Validates that the application is up and running. It will fail if the application crashes or an Out of Memory (OOM) error is detected.

Application Configuration
The application must be configured using ConfigMap and Secrets. It does not hard code values, making it flexible and secure.

Database
The PostgreSQL database is deployed using a StatefulSet with persistent storage.

Application Helm Charts
The Helm chart is designed to deploy the web application on Kubernetes, It includes:

Service
ConfigMaps
Secret
Customizable values in values.yaml.
You can deploy multiple releases of the application on the same K8S cluster using this chart.

CI/CD Pipeline for Helm Charts
A continuous deployment pipeline has been set up in Jenkins to create new releases of the Helm chart.

Automated versioning of the Helm chart using semantic-release.
Updating the version in Chart.yaml.
Creating a GitHub release for the new version of the chart.
Usage
Here are the steps to deploy the web application using the Helm chart:

Using charts in Helm
To create a chart:
# helm create [chart-name]
helm create webapp-helm-chart
To debug your k8s configuration and test it against the k8s api server, use the following command:
# helm install [release-name] --debug -dry-run [chart-name]
helm install webapp-helm-release --debug --dry-run webapp-helm-chart
This command actually verifies your configuration mentioned in the yaml files against a k8s api server

To verify your configuration, but not against a k8s api server, we use templates, which will render the chart templates locally:
# helm template [chart-name]
helm template webapp-helm-chart
To find any errors or misconfigurations in your helm configurations, we use lint:
# helm lint [chart-name]
helm lint webapp-helm-chart
To install a chart onto a k8s cluster:
# helm install [release-name] [chart-name]
helm install webapp-helm-release webapp-helm-chart
To update a chart in an already running k8s cluster:
# helm upgrade [release-name] [chart-name]
helm upgrade webapp-helm-release webapp-helm-chart
To uninstall a chart, use:
# helm uninstall [release-name]
helm uninstall webapp-helm-release
To update your helm dependencies, use the command:
helm dependency upgrade
Once you have edited a chart, helm can package it into a chart archive for you:
# helm package [chart-name]
helm package webapp-helm-chart

To verify that the release was successfully deployed,
  helm list
Uninstall the Chart
 helm uninstall chart-name .
