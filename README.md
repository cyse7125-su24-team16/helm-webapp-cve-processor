## DEPLOYING APPLICATION USING HELM CHART

### Web Application Helm Chart
This Helm chart is designed to deploy a web application on a Kubernetes cluster with various features and best practices.

### Application Health Probes
This Helm chart includes HTTP-based Readiness and Liveness probes for the web application.

Readiness Probe: Ensures that the application can connect to the database and is ready to serve traffic. It will fail if the application cannot connect to the database.
Liveness Probe: Validates that the application is up and running. It will fail if the application crashes or an Out of Memory (OOM) error is detected.

### Application Configuration
The application must be configured using ConfigMap and Secrets. It does not hard code values, making it flexible and secure.

### Database
The PostgreSQL database is deployed using a StatefulSet with persistent storage.

### Application Helm Charts
The Helm chart is designed to deploy the web application on Kubernetes. It includes:

Service
ConfigMaps
Secret
Customizable values in values.yaml
You can deploy multiple releases of the application on the same Kubernetes cluster using this chart.

### CI/CD Pipeline for Helm Charts
A continuous deployment pipeline has been set up in Jenkins to create new releases of the Helm chart.

Automated versioning of the Helm chart using semantic-release.
Updating the version in Chart.yaml.
Creating a GitHub release for the new version of the chart.

### Usage
To create a chart:


### To create a chart:

- Create the docker Registry Key:
Create a secret for Docker Registry authentication.

```bash
helm create webapp
```

- To debug your Kubernetes configuration and test it against the Kubernetes API server, use the following command:

```bash
helm install webapp --debug --dry-run webapp
```
This command verifies your configuration mentioned in the YAML files against a Kubernetes API server.

- To verify your configuration locally without an API server:

```bash
helm template webapp
```

- To find any errors or misconfigurations in your Helm configurations, use:

```bash
helm lint webapp
```

- To install a chart onto a Kubernetes cluster:

```bash
helm install app webapp
```

- To update a chart in an already running Kubernetes cluster:

```bash
helm upgrade app webapp
```

- To uninstall a chart:

```bash
helm uninstall webapp
```

- To update your Helm dependencies, use

```bash
helm dependency update
```

- Once you have edited a chart, Helm can package it into a chart archive for you:

```bash
helm package webapp
```

- To verify that the release was successfully deployed:

```bash
helm list
```

- To uninstall the chart:

```bash
helm uninstall webapp
```
